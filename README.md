This fork survives to keep the old looks and feels of illogical impulse and hyprland intact. I just simply prefer the vibrant, glassy feels of the old illogical impulse.

You might need to get some extra dependencies to get this work. The trickest part is AGS 1.8.2 (I'm just disappointed at how you maintained your projects, Aylur). Other dependencies can be found on the AUR:

```
yay -S anyrun-git gjs gradience gtksourceview3 python-material-color-utilities xorg-xrandr yad
```

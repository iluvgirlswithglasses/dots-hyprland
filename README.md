You might need to get some extra dependencies to get this work. The trickest part is AGS 1.8.2 (I'm just disappointed at how you maintained your projects, Aylur). Other dependencies can be found on the AUR:

```
yay -S anyrun-git gjs gradience gtksourceview3 python-material-color-utilities xorg-xrandr yad
